## What is Slaanesh about?
Slaanesh is a game tracker, allowing for keeping track of games played as well as maintaining a wishlist and backlog.

## Screenshots
Nice screenshots

## Setup and installation
stuff

## Scope and roadmap
### Not in scope
Slaanesh does not and will not include:
* Anything other than video games
* Social media features
* The ability to download or start games from within Slaanesh - it's a tracker, not a launcher

### Feature wishlist
Pull requests to implement these are extremely welcome, I'm not working on those myself, though:
* Ratings for games (including config option to enable/disable)
* More store IDs than just Steam (including config options to enable/disable)
* Expand settings dialog to enable modifying the config file from within the UI

### Roadmap
Features I am currently actively working on (pull requests very welcome for support on these!):
* Overview page UI improvements - table alignment, graphs, additional stats, configurability in config file
* Cover cleanup - setting button to delete downloaded covers of games that are no longer in the game list
* General UI improvements, especially considering responsiveness - there is probably a lot that can be done with asyncio which I have barely used so far

## How to contribute
Bug reports are always useful.
Even better, it'd be absolutely awesome if you could submit a pull request for anything that might need fixing or improving :)
