# Security Policy

## Security goals

Security is not a major concern for this project. Obviously, since it doesn't even have a login page or user management. I simply can't provide proper secure auth or similar - but luckily there are much more professional tools for that, like Authentik. Use a proper auth solution if you want to make this available to others. The design assumes that it's only accessible to you and yourself behind a firewall/VPN.
